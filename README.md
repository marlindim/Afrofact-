# 📖 AfroFacts

AfroFacts is an AI-powered storytelling app that revives Nigerian history, culture, and legends 🎬.
It transforms raw facts into engaging Nollywood-style tales enriched with proverbs, humor, and cultural wisdom.

🎯 Goal
Too often, African history is either forgotten, under-documented, or told in a dry academic tone. Younger generations lose connection with their heritage because the stories don’t “speak their language.”
AfroFacts aims to change that by making history feel alive, fun, and relatable. Instead of reading plain Wikipedia entries, users experience Nigerian stories told like gist by a village griot  full of drama, emotion, and cultural flavor.

## 🏆 Problem We’re Solving
* Accessibility of history → Many Nigerians don’t actively engage with their history because it feels boring or inaccessible.
* Loss of oral tradition → Folklore and proverbs once passed down by elders are fading in the digital age.
* **Cultural identity gap** → Younger Nigerians struggle to connect with their roots in a way that feels modern and engaging.

AfroFacts bridges this gap by combining **verified facts** with **AI-driven storytelling**, preserving knowledge while entertaining the audience.
